# day-46_spoti_playlist
Day 46 of 100.

This is like a musical time capsule. The program asks the user what date they'd like to go back to(YYYY-MM-DD) and based on that will scrape the Billboard top 100 songs on that date.

Then, it creates a Spotify playlist with those songs automatically added to it, provided Spotify even has said-name songs. If it doesn't, then a message is printed out that the song was skipped. A challenging, yet fun and rewarding project for sure.
